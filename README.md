TestSwift
=========

We can create navigation-based application without storyboard in Xcode 6 (iOS 8) like as follows:

    Create an empty application by selecting the project language as Swift.
    Add new cocoa touch class files with the interface xib. (eg. TestViewController)
    In the swift we have only one file interact with the xib i.e. *.swift file, there is no .h and .m files.
    We can connect the controls of xib with swift file same as in iOS 7.
